## About Me
Hi, I'm **Mena Tobia**, a sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill majoring in Computer Science (B.S.) with a passion for mobile app development. My interests lie in software engineering and building impactful, real-world solutions through technology. I’m also exploring different areas of computer science to find the niche that excites me most.

## Skills

### Classes
At UNC, I’ve had the opportunity to dive into computer science through courses like:
- **COMP 110**: Learned the fundamentals of programming, focusing on problem-solving using Python.
- **COMP 210**: (Enrolled) Exploring data structures and algorithms to build a solid foundation for efficient coding.
- **COMP 290**: (Enrolled) Gaining exposure to advanced programming concepts and best practices in software development.

These classes have strengthened my ability to write clean, efficient code and problem-solve in a structured way.

### Tools and Programming Languages
Here’s a snapshot of the tools and programming languages I’ve worked with so far:
- **Python**: Used extensively in coursework for problem-solving and algorithms.
- **JavaScript**: Explored through personal projects and web development.
- **Java**: Worked with in COMP 210 for data structures and algorithms.
- **Git**: Leveraged for version control in both class projects and personal repositories.
- **Docker**: Basic understanding from side projects.
- **Xcode/Swift**: Currently learning to build iOS apps in my free time.

I’m constantly learning new tools and languages as I progress in my studies and projects!
